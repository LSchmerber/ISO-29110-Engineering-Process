# General
This repository includes the process used in the different projects present in all of my repositories.
It is based online available ISO 29110 for system development including software and hardware items.
# Goal of a simplified design process
A process is needed to drive engineers and ensure that the designed system fullfit the clients requirements.
The proposed process present in this repository is a document driven process and must be seen as a backbone for systems design and development.
It will also help the developpers to understand were to find the different documentation in the other projects.
# Overview
The next figure give a first overview of the proposed process:

The process is decomposed in 4 Phases with 4 gates and 12 milestones as following:
- Phase 0 (P0) is the project definition and is mainly the system requirements definition + project planification
- Phase 1 (P1) is the engineering definition is dedicated to the system architecture design
- Phase 2 (P2) is the design phase dedicated to the software/hardware design and integration/validation procedures
- Phase 3 (P3) is dedicated to the validation and integration of the system
- Phase 4 (P4) is dedicated to the system delivery
More details are given in the pdf- and doc files present in this repository.

# Contents:
- The main documents are a pdf/doc files name Org_0-Electronic Process Product
- The diagrams folder contains the different diagrams in pdf but also the source used in the diagram editor Yed

# Current development:
Done up to end of Phase P2.

# Modifications/Updates:
As usual you are welcome to improve the documentation and I will be curious to visit the new branches you will proposed with your own modifications.
