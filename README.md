# General
This repository includes the process used in the different projects present in all of my repositories.
It is based online available ISO 29110 for system development including software and hardware items.
# Goal of a simplified design process
A process is needed to drive engineers and ensure that the designed system fullfit the clients requirements.
The proposed process present in this repository is a document driven process and must be seen as a backbone for systems design and development.
It will also help the developpers to understand were to find the different documentation in the other projects.
# Overview
The next figure give a clean overview of the proposed process

# Upgrade/Update
As usual you are welcome to improve the documentation and I will be curious to visit the new branches you will proposed with your own modifications.
